# The app will show a warning but will work for browsing products
# Authentication features will require proper Supabase setup

# Admin User Setup (after Supabase is configured)
# 1. Create user in Supabase Auth with email: admin@jonsstore.com, password: admin123456
# 2. Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
#    UPDATE user_profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@jonsstore.com');
